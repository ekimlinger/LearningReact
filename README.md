# Learning ReactJS
This is a project strictly focusing on learning about the React framework. Out of ease, and mostly habit, this is built on a Node.js/Express.js backend.

## Personal Code
All React code can be found under server > public > assets > scripts and is rendered on the client side using babel.

#### Codecademy
All code under the file codecademy.js is part of their tutorial and is most likely copyrighted by Codecademy and is not intended for use other than learning.

## Install
Clone repo and run `npm install` from the root project folder in a terminal window (provided that you have npm installed on your machine). This should install all the necessary dependancies needed for server runtime.

Run `npm start` from the command line and visit `localhost:3000` in any browser window.


## Suggestions
If you have any suggestions on the code that you see here, or if I am doing something that does not follow best practices please let me know! This repo is strictly for learning and sharing that which I have learned along the way.
